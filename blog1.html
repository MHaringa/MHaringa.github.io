<h2>Bootstrapping StepAIC()</h2>
<p>I work in the field of finance and find that people often rely on OLS regressions for doing predictive analysis. It’s easy to implement and everyone knows about it. OLS regression gives us a very well developed mathematical framework which can be used to develop linear relationships. These relationships can then be used to create forward looking projections. But what about the features? How does one go about selecting the right feature set which can be used to reliably predict the variable under consideration?</p>
<p>Stepwise variable selection is one of the most commonly used variable selection algorithms. The reliability of stepwise and or subset selection techniques is debatable. If you are a statistician chances are you are not a big fan of such algorithms. None the less, such techniques are popular and I have come across a lot of people using them.</p>
<p>One of the ways one could make the stepwise selection process more reliable is by bootstrapping it. The process can be broken down into the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select a random subset from your data set</li>
<li>Run stepwise selection on this subset</li>
<li>Record the features that were selected</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 to 3 many times</li>
</ol>
<p>The end result is that now we can see how many times a specific feature (predictor variable) gets selected. Now, this bootstrapping technique just creates a random data set from the given data set (drawing with replacement). One could try to run a bootstrap procedure by creating a random starting point for the stepwise algorithm to work on.</p>
<p>Hopefully this little extra step would give you some insight as to which predictor variables could be most useful.</p>
<p>The bootStepAIC package is written by Dimitris Rizopoulos.</p>
<p>The following code snippets follow the post above. For this simple example I’ll use the Managers data set in the Performance Analytics package.</p>
<p>Lets first install the required package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Loads package into memory

<p>Now that we have the data set loaded up, we can do some basic exploratory analysis. The Managers data set is made of the following variables:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Hedge Fund Returns
<ul>
<li>HAM1 to HAM 6</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Risk Factors
<ul>
<li>EDHEC Long Short Equity</li>
<li>SP500</li>
<li>US 10 Year Treasury yield</li>
<li>US 3month Treasuty yield</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Lets try to plot the kind of relationship HAM2 has with each of the risk factors. We’ll use the pairs function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Create a dataframe using HAM2 and the risk factors
df &lt;- tbl_df(managers) %&gt;%

<p>Notice that even though we have only two predictor variables, the model’s predictive power hasn’t changed a lot.</p>
<p>What if we wanted to add a treasury variable to the mix? Which one would you pick? If we had some prior knowledge regarding HAM2 portfolio holdings, we might be able to make a qualitative judgement regarding whether to use the 10 year or the 3 month treasury yield. If not, we could use the bootstrap procedure to derive some useful information.</p>

<p>Let’s draw some observations from the above output:</p>
<ul>
<li>EDHEC LS EQ is selected as a predictor everytime</li>
<li>US 3M TR is selected as a predictor 34% of the time (US 10Y TR is selected 21% of the time)</li>
<li>Coefficient sign on the treasury variables suggest a positive relationship (since 90-95% of the time the coefficients were positive in nature)</li>
<li>US 3m TR had a statistically significant coefficient 38.24% of the time</li>
</ul>
<p>The above observations can make it easier for us to decide which of the two treasury variables we could use as a possible predictor. We could also use this information to align our view regarding the HAM2 portfolio. If the portfolio is supposed to be more sensitive towards short term interest rates then this quantitative analysis supports that view.</p>
<p>This really was a simple example but hopefully I was able to get my point across. Thanks!</p>

<h2>Slopegraphs in R</h2>
<p>Slopegraphs compare changes usually over time for a list of nouns located on an ordinal or interval scale. I really didn’t think tables tell stories well and I truly believe slopegraphs are pretty good at telling stories.</p>
<p>Many examples, the first from my The Visual Display of Quantitative Information (1983):</p>

<p>From existing slopegraph functions for base graphics, the most promising one comes from Thomas Leeper. Its far from perfect, as labels don’t align nicely, but you have some control over a number of parameters. Therefore, I created my own slopegraph function in ggplot2 from scratch.</p>
