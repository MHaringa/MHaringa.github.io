If you want to learn practical data science (as opposed to theoretical, academic topics) you need to be able to absolutely shred a dataset. 

What that means is that you need to be able to take a dataset, wrangle it into shape, and use visualization and other techniques to find insights. Therefore it is essential to obtain a solid foundation in two core skill areas:

- Data manipulation;
- Data visualization.

Once you learn these skills *independently*, you can use them *together* for analysis.

In practical terms, this means that as an R user, you should know *ggplot2* and *dplyr* at a minimum. I also recommend learning a few other parts of the tidyverse, like tidyr, and lubridate.
